# Mandy's `TidyTuesday` attempts

Here I will attempt to do the weekly [TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) from `rfordatascience`.

I will use these challenges to improve my data visualisation skills in R, get more practice using Python and potentially to learn D3.

📁 - folder containing all files from a week

📊 - any plots created that week

📃 - analysis script/notebook for that week
